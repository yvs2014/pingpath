1) If minimal ping's slot (network-observe) is not autoconnected (permission denied),
it can be allowed and connected with the following command:
  snap connect pingpath:network-observe :network-observe

2) a workaround to get rid of "/usr/share/libdrm/amdgpu.ids: No such file or directory" message:
  snap disconnect pingpath:opengl
